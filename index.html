            <h1>Executive Summary</h1>
			
			<p>Mr Zern Liew, a Murdoch University PhD researcher, seeks to work alongside a problem-solving team addressing a Wicked Problem in an organisation. This can be changing/improving systems and processes, interpersonal interactions, communications, disruption response, or proactive innovation.</p>
			
			<p><strong>WHAT.</strong> The researcher will facilitate your problem-solving team to use a novel Hybrid Framework. This Framework combines the evidence-based practices of Design Thinking and Pluralistic Counselling. The researcher has decades of consulting experience plus Design, Business, and Counselling qualifications.</p>
			
			<p><strong>WHO.</strong> The researcher is seeking 7-10 participants on an organisational problem-solving team. They should have varied job roles in a Perth-based business or organisation (that is not a charity, university, or management/innovation consultancy). Participation is voluntary and unpaid.</p>

			<p><strong>HOW.</strong> The researcher will work alongside your team, from exploring the problem to determining the most appropriate solution. The work will be highly collaborative, inclusive, respectful, and tailored to your organisation and team. The researcher will interview and observe participants and contribute to the problem-solving work. This research is not an evaluation of the organisation or individuals.</p>

			<p><strong>WHY.</strong> The research seeks to understand how individuals using the Hybrid Framework in a real-life context affects their capacity to respond to uncertainty and complex problems. Your organisation may gain a more innovative and practical response to your Wicked Problem. Participants may gain greater awareness of their problem-solving capacity and experience new techniques and methods.</p>

			<p><strong>WHEN.</strong> A project starting anytime between February and August 2024, that will run for an estimated 12 weeks, working 2-3 days a week. These are estimated figures. The research will work with you to set up a mutually appropriate arrangement. The intention is to see the entire problem-solving process through to a solution.</p>

			<p>More information and details regarding this research are available on this site and upon request should you be interested in participating. You can download this page as a <a href="">PDF <em>Information Letter</em></a>.</p>
			
			
			
			<h1>About this Research</h1>

			<h2>Aim</h2>
			
			<p>This research is exploratory in nature. The intention is to discover how using the Hybrid Framework may affect individual self-beliefs of creative confidence, self-efficacy, resilience, hope, and optimism.</p>
			
			<p><img src="i-Self-Beliefs.svg" /></p>
			
			<p>These characteristics affect how individuals respond to uncertainty and complex problems. They are malleable and will vary across individuals. They are not used to judge whether an individual is good/bad, right/wrong, or better/worse. The researcher wants to understand each participant’s subjective experience of using the Hybrid Framework and how they perceive their capacity to respond to complex problems.</p>


			<h2>Participation Key Activities</h2>
			<ul>
			<li>Participants and the researcher will work collaboratively on the organisation’s Wicked Problem.</li>
			<li>The problem-solving work will follow the Hybrid Framework process (facilitated by the researcher) and use various techniques.</li>
			<li>Participants and the researcher will collaboratively decide on the most appropriate goals, tasks, activities, and techniques.</li>
			<li>Participants will attend four interviews with the researcher. After each interview, participants will confirm the resulting transcripts. In total, these interviews may take up to 4.5 hours.</li>
			<li>When working alongside participants, the researcher will gather data by asking questions and making observations. Temporary recordings will be made to augment notetaking and produce interview transcripts.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Potential Benefits</h2>
			<p>Due to the nature of Wicked Problems, these benefits cannot be guaranteed.</p>
			
			<p>Possible benefits to the organisation include:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Apply an evidence-based problem-solving framework, with facilitation, to your Wicked Problem.</li>
			<li>Increase the likelihood of gaining innovative perspectives and a practical outcome.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Possible benefits to individual participants:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Access semi-structured guidance to reflect on and gain greater awareness of individual capacity when facing uncertainty and complex problems.</li> 
			<li>Learn a new problem-solving framework and experience various interdisciplinary techniques.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Possible benefits to knowledge creation:<p>
			<ul>
			<li>Help contribute new knowledge that addresses gaps in Design Thinking, Pluralistic Counselling, and Organisational Development research.</li>
			<li>Help improve our collective ability to respond to the Wicked Problems we face today and in the future.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Potential Risks</h2>
			<p>Wicked Problems are a mix of uncertainty, contradictions, divergent requirements, and diverse stakeholders. Individuals may experience some situational/momentary anxiety in the following circumstances:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Sharing ideas in brainstorming, offering gut reactions and opinions, experiencing disagreements and criticisms, and practising assertive communication.</li>
			<li>Reflecting on past experiences of failures and rejections.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The researcher is a trained counsellor with experience in helping individuals manage strong emotions. Participants who experience unusual levels of distress may approach the researcher for debriefing. Where relevant, the researcher will support the distressed participant to access ongoing support, such as from the organisation’s EAP provider or Lifeline. (The researcher will not provide counselling.)</p>

			<h2>Participant Privacy and Confidentiality</h2>
			<ul>
			<li>Individual contact details will only be used for this research project.</li>
			<li>Information that identifies individuals will only be stored until the project is complete. All data is de-identified for analysis, publication, and archiving.</li>
			<li>All collected data will be treated as confidential. Identities of individuals will be replaced with labels (such as Participant01, Client02, Expert03, and Client04) prior to analysis, publication, and archiving.</li>
			<li>Research data will be stored on the University’s OneDrive, Qualtrics, and email systems and only accessed via password-protected computers.</li>
			<li>Archived (de-identified) data may be used for future research, but never for commercial purposes.</li>
			<li>The organisation and managers will NOT have access to any of the collected data.</li>
			<li>Recordings will be made to augment the researcher’s notetaking and to generate interview transcripts. When the researcher has made sufficient notes and participants have confirmed their transcripts, recordings will be deleted. Recordings will not be published or archived.</li>
			<li>Interview recordings will be transcribed using the Otter.ai service. This is a service trusted by large institutions and has robust security and privacy policies in place (https://otter.ai/privacy-security). Recordings and transcripts will be removed from Otter.ai as soon as transcriptions are complete.</li>
			</ul>
