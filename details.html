            <h1>The Hybrid Framework</h1>
			
			<p>The Hybrid Framework combines the creative breadth of Design Thinking with the psychological depth of Pluralistic Counselling. Both are evidence-based, problem-solving frameworks.</p>
			
			<p><img src="i-Hybrid-Framework-Phases.svg" style="margin:1em 0" /></p>
			
			<p>There are six phases in the Hybrid Framework:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Understand the problem</li>
			<li>Define the aspects to tackle</li>
			<li>Generate ideas</li>
			<li>Prototype ideas</li>
			<li>Test the most likely solution(s) with real stakeholders</li>
			<li>Implement the selected solution</li>
			</ul>

			<p>A wide range of techniques – from Design, Counselling, Organisational Development, and Business Management – will be used with the Hybrid Framework.</p>

			<p>* The number of weeks is indicative only. The researcher will negotiate an appropriate timeframe/engagement period with your organisation to suit the problem-solving project.</p>
			
			
			
			<h2>Phase 1 Working Together:<br/>Understand the problem and context; and Interview 1</h2>
			<ul>
			<li>Participants attend Interview 1, which will take up to 1 hour. They will then confirm their transcript.</il>
			<li>Understand the context of the problem, including subjective perspectives from the team, stakeholders, and leaders.</il>
			<li>Understand the team’s thoughts about how to approach this Wicked Problem and what had worked/failed in the past.</il>
			<li>Formulate a big-picture problem statement.</il>
			</ul>


			<h2>Phase 2 Working Together:<br/>Define goals, tasks, and success</h2>
			<ul>			
			<li>Collaboratively determine the goals and tasks of this project.</il>
			<li>Collaboratively determine the success indications, considering the views and needs of different stakeholders.</il>
			<li>Discover existing strengths and resources of the organisation and individuals.</il>
			</ul>

			<h2>Phase 3 Working Together:<br/>Generate ideas</h2>
			<ul>			
			<li>Engage in brainstorming and other idea-generation methods.</il>
			<li>Select appropriate ideas to prototype.</il>
			<li>Revisit earlier phases if new insights or information arise.</il>
			</ul>

			<h2>Phase 4 Working Together:<br/>Prototype ideas</h2>
			<ul>			
			<li>Rapidly prototype selected ideas.
			<li>Discuss the outcomes of prototyping and note new ideas and insights.</il>
			<li>Revisit earlier phases if new insights or information arise.</il>
			<li>Shortlist solutions most likely to meet the agreed goals.</il>
			</ul>

			<h2>Phase 5 Working Together:<br/>Test Potential Solutions and Interview 2</h2>
			<ul>			
			<li>Design, plan, and build working solutions to test with stakeholders.</il>
			<li>Conduct tests, make observations, and solicit feedback from stakeholders.</il>
			<li>Review test outcomes and note new ideas and insights.</il>
			<li>Revisit earlier phases if new insights or information arise.</il>
			<li>Decide on the most appropriate solution to implement.</il>
			<li>Participants attend Interview 2, which will take up to 1 hour. They will then confirm their transcript.</il>
			</ul>

			<h2>Phase 6 Ending Working Together:<br/>Implement the Selected Solution</h2>
			<p>Depending on the nature of the implementation work, the researcher may reduce his time (or completely cease) working alongside the problem-solving team. The problem-solving team will focus on implementation tasks.</p>
			<p>The subsequent two research tasks will occur after the researcher ceases working alongside the problem-solving team.</p>

			<h2>Phase 6 Post-working Together:<br/>Interview 3</h2>
			<p>About 4 weeks after ceasing to work alongside the problem-solving team, the researcher will invite each participant to the third one-on-one interview.</p>
			<p>This interview will explore participants’ reflections on the problem-solving work and the experience of the Hybrid Framework. This interview is expected to take up to 1 hour. Participants will then confirm their transcript.</p>

			<h2>Phase 6 Post-working Together:<br/>Interview 4</h2>
			<p>About 4 weeks after Interview 3, the researcher will invite each participant to the fourth and final one-on-one interview. This interview aims to gather participants’ further reflections and final thoughts on the problem-solving work and the experience of the Hybrid Framework. This interview is expected to take up to 30 minutes. Participants will then confirm their transcript.</p>
			
			
			
			<h1>Working Relationship</h1>
			<p>The researcher will work to foster the following working conditions:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Inclusive of differences and diverse thoughts and perspectives. We see the value in and build on other’s input.</li>
			<li>Open, authentic, safe, and courageous conversations. We speak for ourselves.</li>
			<li>Collaboration based on respect and trust. We don’t have to agree on everything, but we can always be respectful.</li>
			<li>Recognition of everyone’s strengths and preferences. We all bring our uniqueness to work, and that uniqueness has value.</li>
			<li>Relaxed, playful, and optimistic. Even when we are dealing with really serious matters.</li>
			<li>Valuing mistakes and failures as learning experiences. We strive to find the possibilities in each stumble.</li>
			<li>Not seeing the researcher as an expert whose voice cannot be challenged and overrides other voices.</li>
			<li>Authentic feedback, both negative and positive, to the researcher is greatly encouraged.</li>
			</ul>

			<h1>Examples of Interview Questions</h1>
			<p>The interviews in this research are designed to hear participants’ thoughts and feelings without judgment. They are not evaluative. There are no right or wrong answers. The interview style will be relaxed and conversational.</p>

			<p>Here are three examples of interview questions participants can expect:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>How would you describe your self-beliefs of creative confidence, self-efficacy, resilience, hope, and optimism? How have these changed from before you began engaging with this research?</li>
			<li>How comfortable are you with sharing non-optimal or not-completely-thought-through thoughts and ideas?</li>
			<li>What was your experience of (a) using the Hybrid Framework and (b) engaging with the researcher?</li>
			</ul>
